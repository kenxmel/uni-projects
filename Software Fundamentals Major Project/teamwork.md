## Iteration 2

####    How often you met, and why you met that often

Iteration 2 went much more smoothly due to the our preparational development from Iteration 1. 

In this iteration, we met 2-3 times per week where each session was at least 3 hours. This style of work benefitted the group as we could work together if problems occured and also have time to individually work on our functions between meetings. 

Prior to each meeting, we cross-referenced with our ongoing to-do list in Slack so we all understood what had to be completed/dicussed in each meetup. At the end of each meeting, we ensured that each team member would share tasks they were expected complete by the next meeting. This was to ensure each member understood the work they had to complete to keep them accountable. Our online method of communication was via Slack, where we would discuss our meetup time and place which was convenient and best for all members. 

Overall, face-to-face meetups were very successful, as communication between team members had no delay and all conflicting issues with implementation could be resolved in a timely manner. 

####    What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful

For iteration 2, we used flow-based planning which consisted of team members taking items off a queue of to-do items (sorted by priority in iteration 1). For our short timeframe, this allowed work to be constantly completed and for our team to adapt to changes in the specifications. 

The group, as a whole came together and discussed the difficulty of each specific function that must be implemented for Iteration 2. In Iteration 1, we followed a technique called an incremental life cycle, where we already implemented all the stub functions beforehand, which didnt take too long as we were dealing with dummy values. In this way, this cycle can ensure that before even starting the Iteration 2 we had an idea of how each functions was supposed to work and how we were all planning to access the database. 

This gave us an insight of what to expect and kept us thinking of how the data could potentially be accessed. We then slowly shifted towards a flow-based agile in Iteration 2 since, in Iteration 1 we completed all the stub functions and had insight of each function difficulty and the time frame it could be completed in.


####    What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration to

At the beginning of iteration 2, we attempted to use an iteration-based approach which was rather inefficient as we may finish some functions considerably quickly with excess time which could be spent on further functions. At the end of each meeting we would once again schedule each group member new functions to work with, however there were often cases where some group members were still unfinished with their specific function in the previous 'mini sprint' or block period. Realising our time constraint we adapted our approach to a flow-based style which would allow a more appropriate spread of time on the chunks of functions delivered to each group member. 

In order to avoid any unwanted stagnation within the development of Iteration 2 functions, we would usually only assign functions that were linked to the member's previously completed functions so that their progress would not affect the group collectively.

Also upon the feedback from Iteration 1, it seemed that our user stories and epics were lacking and therefore we constructed more to make the project have more stable requirements.

####    Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code

Using git operations such as branching, we ensured that multiple people can work on the same code. If merge conflicts arose, the affected members would discuss and reach an agreement more effectively as merge conflicts can be reviewed through gitlab. 

Furthermore, in order for all group members to stay on the same page, we created a file called component/general.py which contained all the helper functions that we would need to access in order to implement the actual functions. This allowed our time to be spent more effectively as group members would not need to repeatedly code the same functions. Commenting played a huge role in this assignment overall, as code style varied between members, so everyone commented their code to an extent anyone could view the code and understand its functionality. 

We also decided to draw out a visual representation of our database and what type of data was meant to be in each type field. This was all made accessible to all group members on the slack application, where we would all communicate online all our coding obstacles and further communciate any ambiguities within the assignment specification.
